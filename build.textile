h1. How it works

BoxGrinder Build has a plugin architecture. We can distinguish three types:

# *Operating System plugins* - generating base appliance for selected OS,
# *Platform plugins* - creating converted base appliance for selected platform,
# *Delivery plugins* - designed to deliver your new appliance to a specified location. For example as a tar file to a remote server or just register as AMI on EC2
