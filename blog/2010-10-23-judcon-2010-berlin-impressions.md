It's
over two weeks after JUDCon and I hadn't wrote anything yet. Now
it's finally time to share my impressions on last
[JUDcon Europe we had in Berlin](http://www.jboss.org/events/JUDCon/JUDCon2010Berlin.html).
This was the first JBoss User and Developer Conference in Europe.
How it was? What I liked the best? Read on!
# Berlin

Yes, it's a great choice for conference (and not only!). Transport
infrastructure is on highest level. You spend no time to wait for
next train/tram, no traffic jams if you arrive by car.
# Venue

Conference was held in
[Radialsystem V](http://www.radialsystem.de/rebrush/index.php).
This is a really nice venue – perfect for such mid-size conference.
There was one big room downstairs (for 200 people) where everyone
could sit down and talk with others. We had there lunch and dinner.
There were also 2 rooms with space for 60 people upstairs where the
talks were presented.
# Talks

had four tracks: SOA and integration, Cloud and large sale
distributed systems, Workflow and BPM and JBoss AS 6 and 7. I
attended Cloud and JBoss AS tracks.

**[Infinispan](http://www.jboss.org/infinispan)** talks (we had
many of them, maybe too many...) were really well attended.
[Galder](http://galder.zamarreno.com/) and
[Markus](http://community.jboss.org/people/mircea.markus) have done
great job introducing us to Infinispan and talking about Infinispan
internals!

[Bela](http://belaban.blogspot.com/) had presented a
brand new talk on clustering **JBoss AS in the Cloud** – as always
– it was pleasure to listen to him. The talk showed all various
methods we have in JBoss AS to discover nodes in the Cloud. And the
live demo part (80% of the talk) was great!

Next we could see
[Pete's](http://community.jboss.org/people/petemuir) talk on
**Seam in the Cloud** – he presented the ability to integrate JBoss
Developer studio and a JBoss AS running in the Cloud. Very nice!

Adrian
(a.k.a. jclouds guy) and
[Aslak](http://community.jboss.org/people/aslak) gave us
introduction to testing in the Cloud. Can you imagine testing
worker nodes in the Cloud? Try
**[Arquillian](http://www.jboss.org/arquillian)** and
**[jclouds](http://www.jclouds.org/)**!

On the next day I saw
[Jeff's](http://jmesnil.net/weblog/) talk on
**[HornetQ](http://jboss.org/hornetq)** – very clean and
informative talk. I like very much live demos – and I saw that
people enjoyed it too!

Then I saw a
**[Drools](http://www.jboss.org/drools)** talk showing us the
application of the rule-based engines in assistive technology. This
was a video teleconference with US because
[Tihomir](http://community.jboss.org/people/tsurdilovic) couldn't
make it to Berlin. It went extremely well – even when there was no
presenter on the stage. Thanks Tihomir!

Next talk on JBoss AS felt
out because the presenter was sick and I presented
**[BoxGrinder](http://www.jboss.org/boxgrinder.html)**. Even when
people expected another talk – many of them stayed and listened to
my talk. I'm very happy how it went (glad I prepared some slides in
the train). Thanks guys for listening and for all the questions!

Last talk I saw was presented by Matt and the topic was
**JBoss AS performance tuning techniques**. Matt showed pretty easy
tools which can help us to diagnose the problems. Good!

# Hackfest

On first day, after the dinner, we had Lightening talks and
[Hackfest](http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15929). This was the
time where people meet, drink beer, code and talk. Simple? Yes, it
is. But you can receive much more than just a free beer. You can
exchange your experience with other community members, more – with
JBoss developers! You can, or even should code something (see name:
Hackfest) with our developers.

And besides of this – it's a great
way to spend time! I finally met people I'm talking on daily basis
on IRC – and it was a great experience. Thanks!
# Summary

For me it was a very nice conference. I was feeling like a
community member. Only Hackfest could be more organized, as
[Mark pointed out](http://community.jboss.org/en/judcon/blog/2010/10/19/judcon-berlin-2010-retrospective).
In spite of this – it was a great time for me. Thanks and see you
next year!
