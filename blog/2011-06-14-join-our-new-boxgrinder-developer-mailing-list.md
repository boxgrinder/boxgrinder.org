We decided to create a mailing list for BoxGrinder development purpouses. This will help us inform you on what we're currently working and what are our plans for the future. More importantly - this will be the place where **YOU can influence the BoxGrinder development with new ideas or comments** regarding our current work.

# Join us!

Send an empty email to `boxgrinder-dev-subscribe@boxgrinder.org`. For detailed instructions see our [community page](/community).

# What is the best place to...

We have now mailing list **and** forums. Where should you post your questions? All user questions (bugs, help requests, etc) go into forums, whereas all development talks (comments on code, new ideas, feature requests, contributions) should go into mailing list.

See you soon!
