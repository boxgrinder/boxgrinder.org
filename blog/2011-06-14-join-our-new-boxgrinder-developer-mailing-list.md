We decided to create a mailing list for BoxGrinder development purposes. This will help us inform you about what we're currently working on, and what are our plans for the future. More importantly - this will be the place where **YOU can influence BoxGrinder development with new ideas or comments** regarding our current work.

# Join us!

Send an empty email to `boxgrinder-dev-subscribe@boxgrinder.org`. For detailed instructions see our [community page](/community).

# What is the best place to...

We now have a mailing list **and** forums. Where should you post your questions? All user questions (bugs, help requests, etc) go into forums, whereas all development talk (comments on code, new ideas, feature requests, contributions should go into the mailing list.

See you soon!
