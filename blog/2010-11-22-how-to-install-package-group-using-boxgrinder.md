If you want install a
specified package in an appliance â€“ you simply add it to packages
section, like that:

    packages:
      includes:
        - bash
        - mc
        - ...


Simple. But you can do more.
[Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) (and
[RHEL](http://www.redhat.com/rhel/) too) has notion of groups. This
helps you install a specific group of packages to have a selected
functionality installed; for example
[GNOME Desktop](http://www.gnome.org/).
# What package groups are available?

Please use `yum grouplist` command for a full list of available
package groups. Below you can find an **incomplete** (stripped

# Core group

There is also one(?) additional group called **core**. This group
contains a minimal package set and is considered as
[JEOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_enough_operating_system)
for Fedora. For Fedora 14 this group installs **192 packages**
(total list - including dependencies) which is a quite good result.
Installed packages on disk take about **500 MB**.

If you want
create JEOS for Fedora using BoxGrinder, just specify the @core
package group in packages list:

    packages:
      includes:
        - @core

We have an open issue to set @core package
group a minimal package set to install on appliances. See
[BGBUILD-89](https://jira.jboss.org/browse/BGBUILD-89) for more
info. You can of course mix the package groups with packages - feel
free to experiment!

    packages:
      includes:
        - @core
        - @XFCE
        - mc
