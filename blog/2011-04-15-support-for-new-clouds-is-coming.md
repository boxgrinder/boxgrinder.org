What's good? Support for new Cloud. What's better? Support for many new Clouds! You want it, you have it!

I'm excited to share with you that with the upcoming 0.9.1 version BoxGrinder will support new Clouds: [ElasticHosts](http://www.elastichosts.com/), [SKALI Cloud](http://www.skalicloud.com/), [Open Hosting](http://www.openhosting.com/), [Serverlove](http://www.serverlove.com/) and [CloudSigma](http://www.cloudsigma.com/).
