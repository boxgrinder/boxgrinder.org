Thanks to [Max](http://spevack.livejournal.com/) and
[Robyn](http://wordshack.wordpress.com/) (and of course my
[boss](http://bob.mcwhirter.org/)!) I was able to attend this
year's
[FUDCon in Tempe, AZ](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Tempe_2011).
I submitted a talk proposal about
[BoxGrinder](http://boxgrinder.org).

This was my first time at a BarCamp-like conference. I was
surprised how the topic selection works. Every submitted talk (and
there was about 70 talks at least!) was introduced by speaker in
the main room in about 15 sec. This time must suffice to attract
the people to attend the session. I like it this way â€“ community
chooses tracks they want listen to.

My BoxGrinder talk was
accepted. Not sure if it was because of the topic itself or
stickers that arrived one day before the conference :) Thanks Toby
and James! Either case - my talk was scheduled right after BarCamp
ended and we were forced to change the location. I had about 25
people or so. I think the talk went quite good, got a lot of
questions. The difference between FUDCon and other conferences
where I presented is that I got here more technical questions.
**Thanks for attending my talk.** Slides are available in my
[previous post](/blog/fudcon-2011-tempe-slides-from-boxgrinder-talk).


I attended some other (mostly cloud-related) sessions and met
several people I knew only from IRC. It's always fun to assign an
'avatar' to an IRC nick :) I've talked a lot with
[Chris](http://clalance.blogspot.com/) from
[Aeolus](http://aeolusproject.org/) team and Graziano from
[Eucalyptus](http://open.eucalyptus.com/).

With Chris we talked
about possibility of **replacing appliance-tools** with
[oz](https://github.com/clalancette/oz). Unfortunately we faced
some performance issues in a virtualized environments which
prevents the integration at this point :( Maybe in the future I'll
take a look one more time on how to make it possible.

I and Graziano worked on an
[Eucalyptus](http://open.eucalyptus.com/) plugin for BoxGrinder. It
was quite straightforward as Eucalyptus is almost 1:1 AWS clone. we
faced some minor issues, but
**expect to have Eucalyptus support added to BoxGrinder soon**!

I
learned some new **YUM commands** from James Antill. You can get
transcript from this talk
[here](http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fudcon-room-1/2011-01-30/fudcon-room-1.2011-01-30-14.40.log.txt).
Skim it to grab the juicy commands.

Perry Myers (with a BoxGrinder sticker on his laptop!) presented
[**Matahari**](https://fedorahosted.org/matahari/) which is a
system for managing system services using agents connected to a
bus. It's pluggable, so you can write your own agent to meet your
needs. Transcript is located
[here](http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fudcon-room-3/2011-01-30/fudcon-room-3.2011-01-30-14.40.log.txt)
(2nd half of it) and slides
[here](https://fedorahosted.org/matahari/wiki/MatahariOverviewPreso).

At the end of first day at FUDCon we went to **FUDPub** to enjoy
some beers with others, chat and play games! I was surprised on how
good it was organized. We had a few bowling tracks for us,
ping-pong, snooker and some other fun stuff. Thanks Fedora!

And of
course I enjoyed Tempe. Drink some beers at
[Gordon Biersch's brewery](http://www.gordonbiersch.com/) and
walked around the city. Took also a quick trip to Phoenix. You can
see all my photos

Yes, **FUDCon in Tempe was a great experience**, thanks everyone
for organizing and attending this event. see you next time!
