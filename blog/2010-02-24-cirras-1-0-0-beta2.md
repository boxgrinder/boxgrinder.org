I'm pleased to
announce availability of CirrAS 1.0.0.Beta2. This release includes
several bug fixes and a bunch of new (or updated) technologies. You
can find in
[CirrAS JIRA](https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/CIRRAS) list of
[closed tickets](https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/CIRRAS/fixforversion/12314209).

# RHQ

![image](/images/rhq_logo.png "RHQ")

[RHQ](http://www.rhq-project.org/display/RHQ/Home)
is the platform used for JBoss products (but not only!) management
and monitoring. With Beta2 we're using latest RHQ 3.0.0.B03
version. Release notes for RHQ 3.0.0.B03 can be found
[here](http://www.rhq-project.org/display/RHQ/Release+Notes+3.0.0.B03).

Beginning with CirrAS 1.0.0Beta2 you have now a working monitoring
and managing suite. On management appliance we have deployed RHQ
server. You can reach it on port **7080**. Default username and
password for RHQ Server is **rhqadmin**/**rhqadmin**. Every node in
the cluster comes also with a preinstalled RHQ Agent.
## How it works?

1.  On management appliance RHQ server is started and reconfigured
    for your environment,
2.  RHQ agent on every node is reconfigured so it will know where
    RHQ server is located.
3.  On every node RHQ agent starts and connects to RHQ server.
4.  Every discovered service by RHQ agent is submitted to RHQ
    server.
5.  Discovered services are hold in Auto-discovery queue.
6.  A script is importing every discovered Apache HTTPD server and
    JBoss AS into RHQ inventory.

Above steps are executed fully **transparently** to end user. End
user only needs to wait a bit and use that stuff!

# JBoss AS 6 Milestone 2


On 16 Feb 2010 [JBoss AS](http://www.jboss.org/jbossas)team
[released](http://bstansberry.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/jboss-application-server-6-0-0-m2-is-out/)
new milestone version ofÂ  JBoss AS 6. This release adds support for
[JPA2](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317) and
[Servlet 3.0](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=315). You can now use
those technologies in CirrAS! New version of
[JBoss Microcontainer](http://jboss.org/jbossmc) is also included.

Full release notes for JBoss AS Milestone 2 are available
[here](http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14791). Don't forget to
check out new great-looking
[JBoss AS project site](http://www.jboss.org/jbossas)!
# S3\_PING

We have a great news for Amazon EC2 users. In EC2 environment
CirrAS **doesn't require** from now GossipRouter. Because on EC2 we
don't have multicast available (which would greatly simplify
cluster formation) we were forced to introduce
[GossipRouter](http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-10890) - a
service running on front-end appliance whose task was to coordinate
back-end nodes. After a new cloud protocol
[S3\_PING](https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-1022) was added
to JGroups - we could remove the unnecessary GossipRouter service
on EC2.

With that change you need add bucket name to encoded
credentials when you're starting management appliance. We updated
our [wiki page](http://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14388) to cover
that.
# Fedora 12

In this Beta we're using [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) 12 as
our platform. Fedora 12 is the latest stable available version.
Release notes can be found
[here](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f12/en-US/html/).
