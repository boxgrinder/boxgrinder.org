This year I had the chance
to attend [Jazoon 2010](http://jazoon.com/). In short - it was a
great conference. Not only because of many good talks, but mostly
because I had the met many great guys.
# First day

On the first day I finally met
[Bela Ban](http://belaban.blogspot.com/). We talked about a few
things which may improve clustering of
[JBoss EAP](http://www.jboss.com/products/platforms/application/)
in the Cloud, so stay tuned!

We saw also Dan Allen presenting CDI
with RESTeasy. This was a nice wrap-up for the topic, really
though-out examples, liked it!

[Heiko Braun](http://errai-blog.blogspot.com/) presented two talks
about GWT used in large scale applications. I'm not familiar with
GWT, nor want to be for now, but the presentation showed us more
general solution: if you have large application - use event-based
solutions.

The new Servlet 3.0 specification was discussed by
[Rajiv Mordani](http://www.java.net/blogs/mode/) - servlet spec
leader. What can I say? Finally we have annotations, web-fragments
and asynchronous processing. Presentation was really good, enjoyed
it.

After the talks there was a networking event - a party at the
cinema :) If you couldn't make it to be there, you lost a great
event. Excellent way to meet new people with a great wine in one
hand and tasty sandwich in second one.
# Second day

The second day I began with hanging with
[Jean Deruelle](http://jeanderuelle.blogspot.com/). Consolidating
[our effort](http://www.jboss.org/stormgrind/projects/cirras.html)
with Jean's [telco stuff](http://www.mobicents.org/) and
[Heiko Rupp's](http://pilhuhn.blogspot.com/)
[monitoring and managing software](http://www.rhq-project.org/display/RHQ/Home)
will be a huge thing for the Cloud. Cannot wait to make it happen!

I saw also a presentation from
[Edgar A Silva](http://twitter.com/jedgarsilva) about integrating
[JBoss ESB](http://www.jboss.org/jbossesb) and
[Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) with many great examples.Â 
JBoss ESB has much potential and it's easy extendable, nice!

Presentation from Doug Tidwell, an IBM evangelist. This was funny
(in positive sense). He presented meta-apis in which IBM is
involved: libcloud and simplecloud. We have
[jclouds](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/) and
[Deltacloud](http://deltacloud.org/), this does a really good job
for us too!

Then JBossians had some beers and good talks in the
pretty Zurich. Was really nice.

# Third day


I began my third Jazoon day with
[Arun Gupta's](http://www.java.net/blogs/arungupta) presentation
about Glassfish and the Cloud. I was really curious what is the
Oracle's proposition *right now* for the topic as I'm directly
involved in this. What can I say? Glassfish deployment in the Cloud
is much harder compared to JBoss using
[CirrAS](http://www.jboss.org/stormgrind/projects/cirras.html).
Really, this is not the way to go if you need to configure
everything after you launch the instances. In that case there is
really no difference between standard and Cloud deployment. In my
opinion if you're leveraging the Cloud, this kind of stuff
(clustering, load balancer configuration) should be automatically
done. Of course using Elastra or RightScale will hide the
complexity, as it was shown on the presentation. [caption id=""

I really waited for [Jean's](http://jeanderuelle.blogspot.com/)
presentation about [Mobicents](http://www.mobicents.org/). It was
great - after general introduction to VOIP we had chance to hear
what the Mobicents project can offer us. And it's more than
calling! Small example of integrating a call machine with an online
store to inform the customer about the order and delivery was
really nice.
# End...

After three days full of presentations, talks and beers the
conference was ended. I hope I have the chance to be there next
year.

P.S. Oh, and the food was just perfect!
