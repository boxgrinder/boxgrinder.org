# *Create Appliance Definition File* - Check out our "documentation page":/documentation for detailed information about the structure and examples.
# *Run BoxGrinder* - BoxGrinder will download all necessary artifacts, build the instance, convert it to selected platform and upload it to selected destination. *All in one process!*
