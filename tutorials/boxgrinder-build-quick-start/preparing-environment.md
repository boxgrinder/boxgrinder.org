1. Preparing environment to use BoxGrinder Build
2. [BoxGrinder Build installation][install]
3. [Build your first appliance][build]

***

To start building appliances you'll need to have a proper environment. You can use the [meta appliance][meta] (simple way) or prepare your own build environment (longer way).

# Meta appliance

See the [meta appliance][meta] page for details on getting it up and running.

# Preparing own build environment

To build appliances using BoxGrinder you need to use Fedora; but don't worry, the *appliances* you create can have any OS that BoxGrinder supports. 

# Fedora 15+

> Info: Fedora 15 and later don't require any preparation before installing BoxGrinder - simply install the BoxGrinder RPMs, this will pull all required packages.

Finished!

You're now ready to [install BoxGrinder Build][install].
