# Plugin introduction

There are three types of BoxGrinder plugins:

1. Operating system plugins
2. Platform plugins
3. Delivery plugins

## Operating system plugins

The goal of this kind of plugin is to create a base image for the selected operating system. Each plugin must inherit the BaseOperatingSystemPlugin class.

* [Fedora plugin][fedora]
* [CentOS plugin][centos]
* [RHEL plugin][rhel]
* [Scientific Linux plugin][sl]

## Platform plugins

Platform plugins convert intermediary deliverables produced by the operating system plugin into a selected platform. A platform could be VMware vSphere or Amazon EC2 for example.

* [VMware plugin][vmware]
* [VirtualBox Plugin][virtualbox]
* [EC2 plugin][ec2]

## Delivery plugins

A delivery plugin moves the deliverables from a platfrorm or operating system plugin to a selected location type. This could be a local directory, SFTP server, Amazon CloudFront or an Amazon S3 bucket.

* [Local plugin][local]
* [SFTP plugin][sftp]
* [S3 plugin][s3]
* [EBS Plugin][ebs]
* [ElasticHosts plugin][elastichosts]

# Plugin configuration

Some of above plugins require additional configuration after install. Please refer to selected plugin documentation for more information on this.

If a plugin configuration is needed, please place it it BoxGrinder configuration file, by default located in `~/.boxgrinder/config`. Example configuration for vmware and local plugins:

    plugins:
      vmware:
        type: personal
        thin_disk: true
      local:
        path: /mnt/builds

Contrast this with the command-line version of the same configuration, noting that we must indicate which stage in the build pipeline our configuration options belong to:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p vmware -d local --platform-config type:personal,thin_disk:true --delivery-config path:/mnt/builds
    
> Settings within the config file are merged with any arguments provided on the command-line.  Command-line arguments take precedence over conflicting conf file options.

### S3 Delivery Plugin

***

This plugin delivers artifacts to a S3 bucket. The plugin is able to deliver artifact in three types:

* **s3** - a packaged (.tgz) image with metadata - good for distribution,
* **cloudfront** - a packaged image with metadata (same as for s3 type) for public download using CloudFront - great for distribution, you need to have CloudFront enabled for your account,
* **ami** - creates an AMI from selected image and registers it in Amazon EC2. After that the AMI will be visible for you as a private image and ready to run. This type is only available for images in EC2 format (converted using "-p ec2" switch).

#### S3 Delivery Plugin supported operating systems

* Fedora - all versions
* RHEL - all versions
* CentOS - all versions

#### S3 Delivery Plugin Supported platforms

* EC2

#### S3 Delivery Plugin Configuration

    plugins:
      s3:
        access_key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY                        # (required)
        secret_access_key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY          # (required)
        bucket: stormgrind-test                           # (required)
        account_number: 0000-0000-0000                    # (required)
        path: /images                                     # default: /
        cert_file: /home/a/cert-ABCD.pem                  # required only for ami type
        key_file: /home/a/pk-ABCD.pem                     # required only for ami type
        region: us-east-1                                 # amazon region to upload and register amis in; default: us-east-1
        snapshot: true                                    # default: false
        overwrite: false                                  # default: false

#### S3 Delivery Plugin Examples

EC2 AMI for `jeos.appl`:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d ami
    
EC2 AMI for `jeos.appl` in `ap-southeast-1` [region](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/3912)

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d ami --delivery-config region:ap-southeast-1    

Packaged VirtualBox appliance delivered to CloudFront server:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p virtualbox -d cloudfront

Packaged VirtualBox appliance delivered to S3 bucket:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p virtualbox -d s3
    
Use overwrite to delete the existing resource with the same name.  This works with AMI, S3 and EBS.

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -d ec2 --delivery-config overwrite:true

You can use overwrite with snapshot, this will overwrite only the _last_ snapshot delivered

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d s3 --delivery-config snapshot:true,overwrite:true

If you enable snapshotted delivery, each version delivered version will have an incremented snapshot number to guarantee naming uniqueness.

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d ami --delivery-config snapshot:true








### EBS Delivery Plugin

***

This plugin delivers appliance as EBS-based AMI to AWS.

> Note: Only appliances converted to EC2 format using EC2 platform plugin can be delivered as EBS AMI's.

> **Warning:** You can use this plugin only on instances running on EC2. This plugin will not work on your local host because we need to mount EBS volume to copy the data and we cannot do a remote mount. You can use meta appliance AMI to create EBS AMI's.

#### EBS Delivery Plugin supported operating systems

* Fedora - all versions
* RHEL - 6

#### EBS Delivery Plugin Supported platforms

* EC2

#### EBS Delivery Plugin Configuration

    plugins:
      ebs:
        access_key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY                        # required
        secret_access_key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY          # required
        account_number: AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER                # required
        delete_on_termination: false                      # default: true
        availability_zone:                                # default: current availability zone
        snapshot: true                                    # default: false
        overwrite: false                                  # default: false
        terminate_instances: false                        # default: false 
        preserve_snapshots: false                         # default: false
	
	
> Note: The delete\_on\_termination flag is used to specify if the root volume should be deleted after the instance is terminated.

#### Region and Availability Zone
The plugin will automatically detect which region you are in, you do not need to provide it manually.  In fact, is not technically possible to deliver an EBS AMI to any other region than that which it is being built in.

You can, however, specify an [availability zone](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/3912) if you wish. 


#### EBS overwrite behaviour

1.  Live instances of the EBS AMI to be overwritten are discovered. By default, if any are returned, an error will be raised advising you to preserve any instance data then terminate the instances. You can set *terminate_instances: true* in your EBS config to instruct the EBS plug-in to terminate these instances on your behalf. Remember that terminating an instance will delete any attached EBS volumes<sup>[1]</sup>. If you desire to preserve a particular EBS volume
before overwriting, just detach it.

2. The AMI is de-registered. This enables the name to be reused.

3. The snapshot used to initialise all instances of the EBS AMI is located. By default this is then deleted, but you can set *preserve_snapshots: true* in your EBS config if you have some reason to retain it.

At the end of this process the original EBS AMI should be gone - with some components still surviving for you to dissect depending on your config. A new version of EBS AMI with an identical name is then built and registered as usual. 

[1] Unless you set _delete_on_termination:false_ for the appliance root, or any other EBS devices that you may have attached, in which case they will become orphaned. 

#### EBS Delivery Plugin Examples

EBS-based AMI for `jeos.appl`:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d ebs

This will destroy the existing `jeos.appl` EBS AMI of the same version and release. If *any instances are still running, the process will halt* before any destructive actions occur:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d ebs --delivery-config overwrite:true

This will destroy the existing `jeos.appl` EBS AMI of the same version and release, but *any running instances of my.appl will be terminated*:

    boxgrinder-build my.appl -p ec2 -d ebs --delivery-config overwrite:true,destroy_instances:true

Overwrite any previous EBS AMI of the same name, version and release as specified in `jeos.appl`, but *preserve any snapshot* associated with the previous build:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -p ec2 -d ebs --delivery-config overwrite:true,preserve_snapshots:true


### ElasticHosts Delivery Plugin

Added in BoxGrinder **0.9.1**

***

This plugin delivers an appliance to [ElasticHosts](http://www.elastichosts.com/) Cloud. It can be used for any Cloud using the ElasticHosts API, such as [SKALI Cloud](http://www.skalicloud.com/), [Open Hosting](http://www.openhosting.com/), [Serverlove](http://www.serverlove.com/) and [CloudSigma](http://www.cloudsigma.com/).

> Note: Only base appliances (output of [Operating System plugins][os_plugins]) can be used by this plugin.

#### ElasticHosts Delivery Plugin supported operating systems

All operating systems are supported.

#### ElasticHosts Delivery Plugin Supported platforms

* See above note.

#### ElasticHosts Delivery Plugin Configuration

    plugins:
      elastichosts:
        endpoint: api.lon-p.elastichosts.com              # required
        username: your-user-id                            # required
        password: your-secret-access-key                  # required
        chunk: 128                                        # default: 64 (in MB)
        start_part: 6                                     # default: 0
        wait: 30                                          # default: 5 (in s)
        retry: 2                                          # default: 3
        ssl: true                                         # default: false
        drive_uuid: b161fd8b-d56s-4eea-9055-669daaec8aa4  # optional
        drive_name: my-bg-drive                           # optional

> Note: `username` parameter is often referred to as  *User UUID*, wheras `password` is usually *Secret API Key*. For CloudSigma specify your e-mail address and password instead of UUID/key combination.

The appliance is **uploaded in chunks**. By default we set the chunk size to 64 MB; you can change this setting with the `chunk` property.

If the plugin encounters any errors while uploading the image it retries the operation up to **three times** (set the `retry` property to adjust, set 0 to disable) starting with the failed chunk. You can use the `wait` property (in seconds) to adjust the time between retries (default: 5). If it still fails you can try to execute the BoxGrinder Build command specifying the chunk to start with using the `start_part` property (default: 0). See examples below.

By default a new remote drive will be created with the name of appliance as the default name. The name is adjustable with `drive_name` property. You may also upload the appliance to an existing drive. In this case you specify the drive UUID as `drive_uuid`. Note that if you specify both `drive_uuid` and `drive_name` the latter will be ignored.

Set `ssl` to true if you want establish a secure SSL connection to the server.

#### ElasticHosts Delivery Plugin Examples

Standard delivery for a sample JEOS appliance:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -d elastichosts

Start delivery with the 6th chunk:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -d elastichosts --delivery-config start_part:6

Use an already existing disk:

    boxgrinder-build jeos.appl -d elastichosts --delivery-config chunk:128,disk_uuid:b161fd8b-d56s-4eea-9055-669daaec8aa4
